# Welcome to Odigos

## Project info:

In today’s fast-paced corporate environment, onboarding new employees effectively remains a major challenge for organizations. Traditional training methods are often time-consuming, costly, and lack personalization. New recruits struggle to navigate complex tools and workflows without proper guidance, leading to decreased productivity and longer ramp-up times. HR departments face difficulties in delivering scalable, role-specific, and engaging training experiences that cater to individual needs. There is a clear need for a modern, cost-effective, and intelligent training solution that not only simplifies onboarding but also enhances employee engagement and performance from day one.
